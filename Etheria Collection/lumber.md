# Lumber

Runs the lumber harvesting loop for Etheria: selects or randomly weights a tier, performs GatherLib's find/harvest checks (respecting advantage, guidance, and tool vs skill extraction), awards tier-based lumber, and auto-stashes the yield in the character's Lumber bag through BagLib so players can immediately track what they gathered.
