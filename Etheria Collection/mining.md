# Mining

Automates Etheria's mining downtime activity. The alias picks a node (rarity-weighted or tier-targeted), rolls the shared GatherLib checks for find/extraction, awards resources using the points model, and logs the haul into the character's Mining bag via BagLib so inventory stays in sync.
